Instructions to compile/run code and run the matcher and the verifier:

For GaleShapley.py, run the python file. It will read the input.txt file, which has the preferences for students and hospitals, and will produce an output file named "output_gale_shapley", which will have the matches.

For verifier, run the python file. Make sure you have input.txt and output.txt.

For scalibility_verifier and scalability_gale_shapley, run the python files and it will output the graph.

The input format in the input.txt file should be as formatted in the example provided in the assignment. EX:

```
3
1 2 3
2 3 1
2 1 3
2 1 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```

output.txt format EX:

```
1 2
2 1
3 8
```

The trend here is clear as the number of hospitals/students increases, the runtime in seconds exponentially increases.
